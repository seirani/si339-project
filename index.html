            <h1>Serena Irani</h1>
		    <p> Hello, I'm Serena! I am a junior pursuing a BSE in Computer Science and a minor in English at 
                the University of Michigan. I currently work as a writer and editor at 
                <a href = "http://www.michigandaily.com" target="_blank">The Michigan Daily</a> and as a 
                peer consultant at U-M's Sweetland Writing Center to assist undergraduate 
                students with writing assistance. My published work is organized here, with critical reviews 
				of TV series, albums and films, as well as long-form "notebook-style" pieces that delve into 
				a variety of artistic and cultural observations. In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring 
                national parks and learning new things!</p>
